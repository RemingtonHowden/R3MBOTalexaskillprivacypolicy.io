PRIVACY POLICY

General
This privacy policy is a contract between you (user) and R3MBOT (supplier) for the use of any services offered by the provider. 
To use one of the skills, you will need to agree to this privacy policy, and if you do not agree you will lose all rights and 
will not be able to use any Supplier Work.

What information is collected?
The Supplier collects only your date of birth. In this ability, it is necessary that this data is saved in a database in which 
the information is connected only to your Alexa-UserId, but never to your name or other personal information.

Changes
Our skills can be updated at any time. In addition, this Privacy Policy may change. You can find a link to this policy on the skill
description page on the Alexa App or Alexa Store. Your continued use of our ability after changes to the Privacy Policy or the skill
itself will be seen as your acceptance of both.
